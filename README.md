# Hybrid-Siamese-Network-and-Chaotic-Visual-Cryptography-


Implemented an algorithm for Biometric Authentication Systems, to secure the biometric template stored on a centralized database using a Chaos-based Colour image encryption technique that intoduces duo confusion and duo diffusion in the RGB planes of the image by employing Chaotic maps -Logistic map, Trent map and Attractors -Lorenz attractor, Lu attractor. The decrypted image is authenticated against the original image using the Siamese Network. 

Dataset:
MIT-CBCL-facerec 

Used Keras and Tensorflow library to implement the CNN network
